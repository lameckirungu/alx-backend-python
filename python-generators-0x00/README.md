# Python Generators
This repository contains solutions to tasks assigned for this project at ALX.
## About
<p>This project introduces advanced usage of Python generators to handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations.<p>
The tasks focus on leveraging Python's `yield` keyword to impement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization, and improving performance in data driven applications.

### Learning Objectives
- Master Python Generators:         
    - Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
- Handle Large Datasets: 
    - Implement batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
- Simulate Real-world         Scenarios: 
    - Develop solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.
- Optimize Performance: 
    - Use generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets, minimizing memory consumption.
- Apply SQL Knowledge: 
    - Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with databases for robust data management.
